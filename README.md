## About

Welome to the Matching Game!

It's a card game that is intended to test the memory of the players in order to improve it! So enjoy!

## Objective

The goal of this game is to find all pairs of each card with the least number of moves.

## Instructions

The player must find the pairs of scrambled cards.

If a pair is found, the two cards will be opened, otherwise they will be flipped again.
The player can restart the game by clicking the reset button next to the timer. However, the cards will be scrambled again.

## Rating

* 3 stars for finding all pairs in up to 16 moves;
* 2 stars for finding all pairs in up to 23 moves;
* 1 star by finding all pairs.

## Building

* The deck of cards was structured and stylized with HTML and CSS;
* The deck was created with 16 cards - being 8 pairs - that are shuffled when starting or restarting the game via Javascript and jQuery;
* I created a motion counter that serves as the parameter for the performance rating of the player;
* I created a timer so that the player can know the time spent in the session played;
* I created a reset button so that the player can restart the game;
* I created a pop-up window that appears when the player finds all the pairs, informing the time spent and their classification.
