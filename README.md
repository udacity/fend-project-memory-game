### How to Play

The game board consists of 4x4 cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

On each turn:

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped back
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched and it will display
